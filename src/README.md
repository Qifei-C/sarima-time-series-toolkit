# SARIMA Modeling Project

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting time series data using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. It includes data preparation, transformation, model identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking.

## 🚀 Core Components

*   **SARIMA Model Implementation**: Code for building and fitting SARIMA models to time series data.
*   **Data Preparation**: Scripts for handling non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity in time series datasets.
*   **Model Diagnostics**: Tools for checking the residuals of the SARIMA model to ensure it captures the underlying patterns of the time series.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SARIMA model in capturing and predicting long-term trends in time series data, such as monthly electricity production.

## 🛠️ Usage

To use this project, you would typically:

1.  Load your time series data.
2.  Perform data transformations and differencing to achieve stationarity.
3.  Identify appropriate SARIMA model orders.
4.  Estimate the model coefficients.
5.  Perform diagnostic checks on the model residuals.
6.  Use the trained model to forecast future values.
